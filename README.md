# APCSP Portfolio

Welcome to my AP Computer Science Principles portfolio! This repository contains a slideshow reflecting on my experience in the course, along with files for each of the four major projects I completed.

## ðŸ“– About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of my work throughout APCSP. It includes:
- A **slideshow** sharing my insights, challenges, and growth in the class.
- Four **major projects** that highlight my understanding of key computing concepts.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

1. **Flashcard App:** This Python program helps users create and review flashcards for studying, storing questions and answers for efficient learning.
2. **Encrypt/Decrypt ASCII Software:** This Python program encrypts and decrypts text using the **caesar cipher**, shifting letters based on a user-defined value.
3. **Password Generator:** This Python program generates a randomized, strong password using user-provided details, ensuring variability with uppercase letters and digits for security.
4. **AI Helpline Chatbot:** This Python program creates a compassionate chatbot that engages users in supportive conversations, detects suicidal thoughts and harmful language through keyword analysis, offers personalized coping strategies based on age and gender, and provides urgent crisis intervention to promote emotional well-being and safety.

Each project folder contains the necessary files, code, and documentation for running the code. 
Instructions are located after each of the projects names above.

## ðŸŽ“ My APCSP Experience

This course was an incredible journey! I explored foundational computer science concepts, worked on exciting projects, and developed problem-solving skills that will be valuable in the future both throughout life and in my career.

Some key takeaways:
- **Understanding algorithms and data structures was a major breakthrough for me;** learning how different structures impact efficiency helped me write cleaner, more optimized code.

- **Debugging complex logic errors was a challenge I overcame;** initially, I struggled with identifying subtle mistakes, but through practice and patience, I improved my troubleshooting skills.

- **My favorite project was the flashcard app because it combined multiple programming concepts,** including file handling, user interaction, and randomized learning. It was rewarding to build a tool that improves studying and helps reinforce knowledge dynamically.
